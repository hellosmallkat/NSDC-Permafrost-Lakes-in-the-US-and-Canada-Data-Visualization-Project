        "Permafrost is a permanently frozen layer on or under Earth's surface. It consists of soil, gravel, and sand, usually bound together by ice. Permafrost usually remains at or below 0°C (32ºF) for at least two years.\n",
        "\n",
        "Permafrost can be found on land and below the ocean floor. It is found in areas where temperatures rarely rise above freezing whether it is at high latitudes or high elevation. This means permafrost is often found in Arctic regions such as Greenland, the U.S. state of Alaska, Canada, Russia, China, and Eastern Europe.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Global warming impact\n",
        "On millennial timescales, natural fluctuations in the number and size of lakes are common but decadal scale studies show that climate change is shifting these dynamic systems across a hydrological threshold, towards landscape-scale wetting (lake formation and/or expansion) or drying (lake drainage, desiccation or infilling). Shrinking lake area extent, for example, could mean a reduction in liquid water sources for villagers and habitat for fish and other aquatic organisms whereas Thermokarst lake initiation and expansion increase methane and carbon dioxide fluxes to the atmosphere.\n",
